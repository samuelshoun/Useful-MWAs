# Useful MWEs

This is a collection of Minimal Working Examples (MWE), each example a component of some solution I've 
found useful in various engineering tasks. I use these to remind myself how to get these methods to work
after I inevitably forget. 

I've also found engineers (and others, I'm sure) tend to learn readily from simple working examples. I 
hope that by sharing the repo, others may find it useful too.

I'm always interested in learning more! If you have suggestions, or if I can help any way, please 
reach out. The best way for now is <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/samshoun>LinkedIn</a>.
